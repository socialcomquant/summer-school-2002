I always count my blessings everyday and remind myself to be thankful. I have a job, a roof above my head, food on the table, a family I can call my own and some provisionings to enjoy some fine things in life.  But there are times when I still wake up sad, lonely..

Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

What does it feel like to be lonely? It feels like being hungry, like being hungry when everyone else around is readying for a feast. It feels shameful and alarming, and over time these feelings radiate outwards, making the lonely person increasingly isolated, and estranged.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

I'm not saying you have to be your best self to find love (I def wasn't), but some people show up on first dates like the walking wounded, and those folks are so vulnerable to abusive types. And it's not just about loneliness and past abuse, but also the fear of remaining alone.
are japanese that lonely? Or are they the ones who are about how lonely people are. And yes i need this robot.
The faster you realize that y’all don’t want relationships you want friendship (cuz you’re lonely) and sex (cuz you’re horny) the faster the date debate would end.   If you are trying to decide how much to spend on a person, you probably don’t even like them like that lmao

@shaneecompton is on his way back to America and now I have 8 months of crippling loneliness to look forward to.
@BTS_twt Hey JK, I hope all the stuff from today don‘t get to you too much.  I feel sorry for the people who wish you bad things, they must live a sad &amp; lonely life. I hope you know how loved you are, from me and from millions of others. We are always here for you,pls know that♥️
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️
I realised recently that I have no friends and bc my life revolves around looking after my mam/work I'm not making any so I'm just gonna be lonely forever rip me
Just because I spend a lot of time alone doesn’t mean I’m lonely

@ChenaOnuorah I doubt if you are Boring, You are probably just Lonely. Or Your Friends are the Busy type and You hardly go out, so the Office is where you be around People and Work keeps your mind busy
The age 19, 20 and 21 ain't easy. you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realise things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, you go through different phases of insecurity, loneliness and frustration, you go through heart break.
Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

@JasonGIles5 You're onto me 😲😂   I think the more attractive they are the worse it gets. Like they assume the only reason anyone wants them around is cause they're romantically invested. Which sounds lonely.

Adulthood is lonely (I’m not feeling sad  btw - just some real shit). Time for people is limited, then we need time to recharge, which for most is done alone. It’s always dark so going out is long so we’re staying inside alone, being ‘social’ on social media but very much alone.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
Lonely is the heart that awaiting to meet the One. But everything has a sacrifice. Even Love.

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
when real friends said it‘s been a lonely year they meant the last twenty years of my life
@iain_claxton I heard you're not allowed to ask them out but it probably still happens. It's one of those situations where everyone is consenting, so even if it is lonely guys, they're consenting to it, so I don't think anyone is taken advantage of.  The idea would never fly here.
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

Adulthood is lonely (I’m not feeling sad  btw - just some real shit). Time for people is limited, then we need time to recharge, which for most is done alone. It’s always dark so going out is long so we’re staying inside alone, being ‘social’ on social media but very much alone.

They try to understand themselves and what they're going through, so if you see people alone don't just assume that they are lonely, respect their space. Alot of them are most of the time, alone by choice.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
the loneliness is haunting me

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

@KiaRichards_ This is a funny take. Men are not supposed to be beautiful,  and the one's that are, have 15 to 20 of the beautiful women at his helm. Many of those well put together women are not only alone, but lonely. See it here in DC quite often. The young ones are ok with it, the 30+, nah

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts, and they’ve got ambition, and they’ve got talent, as well as just beauty. i’m so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. i’m so sick of it but... i'm so lonely https://t.co/bddvG2Feta

Taurus- there’s a strong need to do heart chakra work. Please incorporate fresh, organic whole green &amp; pink foods into your diet to assist with this. I see you holding a rose quartz near your heart, as you are allowing this vibration to heal the sadness &amp; loneliness inside you.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

Tell me just one thing shri rahul kamaal ji. If u have that much conscience, than why u don't educate ur own colleagues to bring these issues on their shows or in prime time. Or it seems u are working lonely and ur organisation is not in direct contact of urs.  Pls clarify.
The faster you realize that y’all don’t want relationships you want friendship (cuz you’re lonely) and sex (cuz you’re horny) the faster the date debate would end.   If you are trying to decide how much to spend on a person, you probably don’t even like them like that lmao

@ltsSaulGoodman Lonely women make good lovers 🤣🤣
You don’t notice how lonely you are until you need a hug and you can’t think of anyone to run to, you need to talk and you can’t think of anyone who’ll understand, you’re here in your room with the weight of the world bringing you down, and nobody outside that door knows a thing
Grief is so sneaky. I think it was @johngreen who said something about losing your co-rememberer. When one of those memories only shared by one other person pops up and that person is not there anymore? My God, that's a lonely feeling.
Deep but it’s insane the power your insecurities and self-worth have in fucking over your mentality on what you think you deserve to the point of being too nice out of fear you’ll be lonely or rejected, mind is blown
@BabyLyssaC And I do mean WORTHLESS... I am certain that loneliness has brought him to this point. Your father is a very wise man. I have to believe that he is pondering on what he is doing and with who. Give it time. Time can be your best friend.

Before you decide you want to get into a relationship. Deal with your shit. Do not try and “fix” someone to be exactly what you’re lacking. Fix yourself. Being lonely fucking sucks but it’s needed more than a relationship most times.
Being somewhat of a loner is lonely, but always surrounding yourself with people who don’t care about you 🤷🏼‍♀️

I wish I had more female friends that I can just hangout with or have over. :( it’s gets lonely when marks not around or when he doesn’t talk to me.
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

The age 19, 20 and 21 ain't easy. you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realise things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, you go through different phases of insecurity, loneliness and frustration, you go through heart break.
A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

Is it normal for me to feel lonely when im not talking to anyone?
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
To be depressed is to be lonely; to have a friend is to be happy.

Once you stop prioritizing men.. and take extra care of yourself... your life WILL improve. You can think clearly. You can focus on your goals. It’s lonely at first but that’s only because you’ve been conditioned to *need* a male’s attention. But, you don’t. Trust me, you don’t.

Adulthood is lonely (I’m not feeling sad  btw - just some real shit). Time for people is limited, then we need time to recharge, which for most is done alone. It’s always dark so going out is long so we’re staying inside alone, being ‘social’ on social media but very much alone.

You can deal with being alone, prefer staying in your room, but you can’t deal with the loneliness you feel around people, people you don’t belong with, loneliness isn’t being alone, it’s being stuck with people you don’t connect with.

Lonely. Want gf here. :(
Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.

As the world fights to figure it out, hold a door for a stranger. Talk to someone who is lonely. Tip generously. Wave at police. Give a kid a thumbs up. Be patient with a sales clerk. Understand more. Judge less. Myself included.  If you can’t find kindness. Be kindness.
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts, and they’ve got ambition, and they’ve got talent, as well as just beauty. i’m so sick of people saying that love is just all a woman is fit for. i’m so sick of it but... i'm so lonely https://t.co/bddvG2Feta
You can deal with being alone, prefer staying in your room, but you can’t deal with the loneliness you feel around people, people you don’t belong with, loneliness isn’t being alone, it’s being stuck with people you don’t connect with.

Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.

Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.
Where’s the obvious lie? You’ve already given all that you have. But you’re tired and I’m lonely.

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

whenever I feel lonely and sad without any reason, I want to cry idk why.
Loneliness is one sad part of adulthood a lot of folks never really like to speak on. Like Depression, sometimes we don't know or are in denial when life starts getting lonely. as we all grow older, our priorities generally change &amp; people generally have less time for friends.

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

Parents of many children tend to be less lonely than their counterparts with fewer children, but this does not necessarily mean that high fertility protects against loneliness. 2/N
For instance, people with a tendency to be lonely have lower fertility, or certain background characteristics may raise the likelihood of low fertility as well as feelings of loneliness. 3/7

Guys who jump from relationship to relationship? They’re insecure, lonely and horny. In that order. They can’t be alone because they’re empty inside and can’t face themselves. Them “moving on,” so quickly after you DOESN’T mean there’s anything wrong with you. It’s them. Not you.
We assessed whether variation in loneliness was attributable to this exogenous fertility difference. For women additional children had a causal protective effect against loneliness. For men, we also found a negative association, but no causality could be inferred. 7/7

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
Sometimes no matter how jolly your personality are or how good your day was u still have this feeling of loneliness and gonna feel down without knowing what's the reason behind it.

Do you want to know a huge reason why society’s eroding? Why people are pathologically lonely and miserable and purposeless? Because of people placing “self-interest” over the things that really matter—the things that require sacrifice yet bring meaning, joy and fulfillment.
I read an article a few years ago about how black men end lonely with no friends in their 40s and 50s. Their have been wrapped up their wives and families. Your relationship with your friends should be just as important as your relationship with your s/o.
"""""""Every one says love hurts, but that is not true. Loneliness hurts. Rejection hurts. Losing someone hurts. Envy hurts. Everyone gets these things confused with love but in reality love is the only thing that covers up all pain and make someone feel wonderful again."""

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

Reminder to those who suffer from any kind of addiction: as a recovering addict, I am fully aware of how lonely and devastating addiction can be. Even with sobriety, I’m still trying to recover past relationships that I destroyed. My DMs are open to anyone who needs to talk!
As the world fights to figure it out, hold a door for a stranger. Talk to someone who is lonely. Tip generously. Wave at police. Give a kid a thumbs up. Be patient with a sales clerk. Understand more. Judge less. Myself included.  If you can’t find kindness. Be kindness.

You can deal with being alone, prefer staying in your room, but you can’t deal with the loneliness you feel around people, people you don’t belong with, loneliness isn’t being alone, it’s being stuck with people you don’t connect with.

@scottsauls I love the “what if.” But in my experience it just isn’t received well. So many married people think the solution to single people’s loneliness is for them to get married. And deep friendships (esp. across genders) are so unusual that outsiders speculate and look for foul play.

Today I realised just how lonely I am, my husband died 12 years ago today and not one text off my family to see how I am mental health is shite as no one wants to talk to you
Literally alone and feeling full outcast right now. Its lonely bitch
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

Having depression is like being tired of everything. You have a fear of failure. It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. You pretend to be happy but you're not. All you can do is beg yourself to stop crying &amp; tell yourself to stay strong.
And maybe you'll never understand how lonely it actually feels to want that for people, to be the one to forgive, to be the one that doesn't separate but loves, some days it feels like I'm on my own tiny planet but I realize it's also a gift.
The way up is mostly lonely. Be brave!

There’s literally a man out there willing to treat you like how you deserve to be treated, do not lower your expectations and settle for anything because of loneliness or sadness.

@BabyLyssaC He will wake up one day but don't give up on him!  He's lost in grief and he's trying to wash it away with trash!  He did an interview where he was weeping about how lonely he is, keep that in mind when your pissed at him for being a man.  Don't let the trash win!
The age 19, 20 and 21 ain't easy. you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realise things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, you go through different phases of insecurity, loneliness and frustration, you go through heart break.

Found a great acronym to ask oneself when feeling overwhelmed by stress, anger or panic. 😉  H.A.L.T. = Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired?  Ask yourself, “Am I Hungry, Angry Lonely or Tired? “That’s the REAL reason you’re feeling overwhelmed! 🤯  #HALT = DON’T ATTACK 😎 #LynnJulian https://t.co/BPjitShphd

Having depression is like being tired of everything. You have a fear of failure. It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely. You pretend to be happy but you're not. All you can do is beg yourself to stop crying &amp; tell yourself to stay strong.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

As the world fights to figure it out, hold a door for a stranger. Talk to someone who is lonely. Tip generously. Wave at police. Give a kid a thumbs up. Be patient with a sales clerk. Understand more. Judge less. Myself included.  If you can’t find kindness. Be kindness.

Some of the most talented and creative people around you, are often the most lonely.
The age 19, 20 and 21 ain't easy. you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realise things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, you go through different phases of insecurity, loneliness and frustration, you go through heart break.
Sometimes when I'm lonely, I close my eyes Some nights when I can't sleep, I fantasize

@NTheAltogether @DianaSheridan11 @SNeurotypicals Might be argued NDs' unusual interests/enthusiasms are a result not of ND, but of confounds, e.g., well, on disability, so have lonely time to read weird books, then they want to talk about 'em, but everyone else is at work or tired from it  I don't think that's true, just a part

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

I been a lonely bitch my whole life because I never been a bitch who be trying to be everybody’s friend , I always been cool with keeping 1 or 2 friends. Everybody just be talking bout each other on the low.

🔮🃏 This truly is you taking your power back and standing in it knowing you are not alone. You can be alone without being lonely and that's the damn truth. You feel that know and you acknowledge that. You are creating out of your experience and growing from it
Life is stressful, cold &amp; lonely.   Wouldn't it be wonderful to have your daily stresses fade away?   For you to enjoy the warmth of a superior grace in your presence?   To experience a thrill and depth that surpasses everything else?   Submission &amp; Servitude.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

The faster you realize that y’all don’t want relationships you want friendship (cuz you’re lonely) and sex (cuz you’re horny) the faster the date debate would end.   If you are trying to decide how much to spend on a person, you probably don’t even like them like that lmao

@LoebeMargaret @creaturecomfrtr The advice that I would give a younger me is that it's fine to want and to seek some emotional and/or physical connection without it having to be A Thing.™  I spent a lot of my 20s very lonely when I didn't need to be. A date and some cuddling would have done me wonders.

The faster you realize that y’all don’t want relationships you want friendship (cuz you’re lonely) and sex (cuz you’re horny) the faster the date debate would end.   If you are trying to decide how much to spend on a person, you probably don’t even like them like that lmao

@DrJoGrady Thank you for speaking out Jo. Just wanted to send a message to counteract some of the hatred getting sent your way and remind you we are not alone in thinking this way! It can feel quite lonely sometimes when only the people who shout the loudest are heard.
The age 19, 20 and 21 ain't easy. you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realise things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, you go through different phases of insecurity, loneliness and frustration, you go through heart break.
The faster you realize that y’all don’t want relationships you want friendship (cuz you’re lonely) and sex (cuz you’re horny) the faster the date debate would end.   If you are trying to decide how much to spend on a person, you probably don’t even like them like that lmao

Sometimes Allah makes you feel weak and lonely in order to remind that you will always be in need of Him and His strength. Without His assistance, you can do nothing.
a relationship is not a cure for loneliness. until you have created a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?

Adulthood is lonely (I’m not feeling sad  btw - just some real shit). Time for people is limited, then we need time to recharge, which for most is done alone. It’s always dark so going out is long so we’re staying inside alone, being ‘social’ on social media but very much alone.

@drpeterblundell I’m a Therapist-in-Training, graduating in May. Psychodynamic and Psychoanalytic approach. At Toronto’s Centre for Training in Psychotherapy. Areas I work well with are dissociation, loneliness, loss, and relationships.
@intezaarlily Yeah, I think so. Not that I begrudge anyone time with their families! Or taking time away from fandom or twitter or whatever to have a real life. It's just felt a little lonely around here. I don't think you've lost the ability at all, and it's very easy to talk to you anyway.

If you see me alone somewhere, please don’t feel bad for me.  I love my me-time. It’s one of the best times that I reflect, plan, read, recharge, and talk to God. I’m actually being productive, for my innerself.  Being alone doesn’t necessarily mean lonely. ♥️

i didn't fall inlove with u because I was lonely. I fell in love with you because after getting to know you, i realized that I wanted to make u a permanent part of my world.
The faster you realize that y’all don’t want relationships you want friendship (cuz you’re lonely) and sex (cuz you’re horny) the faster the date debate would end.   If you are trying to decide how much to spend on a person, you probably don’t even like them like that lmao
The horrifying thing is that they believe that they are right, not that they say it.  I feel sorry for their lonely and misguided brain cell &amp; ashamed that these people are given airtime to speak on this topic as pseudo representatives of our government or our country.  #getsmart
The age 19, 20 and 21 ain't easy. you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realise things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, you go through different phases of insecurity, loneliness and frustration, you go through heart break.
@EvanAKilgore She’s may just be very lonely.

A romantic relationship is not a cure for loneliness. Until you have cultivated a healthy relationship with yourself and are content with being alone, you are not ready to be with someone else. Why should you want someone to be with YOU if you don’t want to be with YOU?
mental illness is so fucking lonely. people tell you to reach out. but when you’re actually struggling &amp; showing symptoms &amp; they can clearly see that, they just ignore it and are annoyed with you for being “negative” or not being how they want you to be

I met Lizzie in law school. She started mid-career as I was starting young. We were both misfits and she was kind and generous and filled spaces that might have otherwise been lonely with her warmth and humor and idiosyncratic voice. She gave a lot to a lot of us. I miss her.

Loneliness is a big problem for many people who work remotely. According to the data we researched with @ApartmentGuide, a majority of workers want flexibility, but 26% feel isolated when working from home. Here's how to fix that. https://t.co/ve4DxGSyVC
always lonely.....
when you form a habit of talking to someone every night and then one night the person isn’t there anymore and everything’s just so sad and lonely💔
Don’t let getting lonely make you reconnect with toxic people. You wouldn’t drink poison just because you’re thirsty.
It's okay to be lonely and it is okay to feel alone... But so you know, I'm here if you need to talk.
@princessjoseya He be lonely
@Sunflowerbun i learned HALT, when feeling bad, examine if you’re hungry, angry, lonely or tired. Remedying one of those usually helps me!!

How sad it must be for you lonely bitch ass niggas to be waiting on a woman to tweet something that seems like their relationship is on the rocks.   Chicks could tweet, “Today was a long day, I can’t even handle with this” and you faggots throw hearts up like it’s your only shot

The road to success is lonely, but you must take that road in order to live the life you are meant to live.

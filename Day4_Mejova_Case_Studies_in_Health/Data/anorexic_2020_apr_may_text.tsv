Happily donating to @beatED right now. Whilst I'm now largely 'recovered' from anorexia even I feel my old habits creeping back in during this time of uncertainty.  We need to support those battling eating disorders more than ever right now ❤️ https://t.co/sJvwTDjkOg	1245111594155151361

@juneshannon @ciarakellydoc @ClodaghShortall Yep.. 4.30/5am wake ups for me at the moment and sick to my stomach. I’m not “actively” worrying about the virus but my anxiety, panic attacks and anorexia all worsening. It’s like osmosis.. the stress is all around me	1245117612574625792
Trying to recover from anorexia during a pandemic where you can’t afford much food is really tough.	1245117725262983173
twitter is my therapy now so i'm just gonna talk about how being in quarantine has made my anorexia so much worse. I can't eat. Being alone and just thinking about food digesting in my stomach makes me fucking neurotic. Last time I ate was saturday and I couldn't stop panicking.	1245121263724646401
How are people w/eating disorders getting through this #QuarantineLife? I was told by my doctor I have an eating disorder but I don’t. I just restrict my calories &amp; try to burn off everything I’ve eaten that day. Apparently that’s called anorexia restrictive type. I need the gym.	1245123460755423232
I hate to do this &amp; am pretty embarrassed to ask but I might have to file for unemployment &amp; struggling to eat right now. With my anorexia recovery, the last thing I need is to not be able to afford food. Anything helps. Thank you in advance. PayPal: stuckbeinggracie@Gmail.com https://t.co/CuKJ2Gwxzy	1245124483548983297

I don’t have body dysmorphia, anorexia or Boulimia. I’m not diagnosed with any of these things.

@overdramatique This is a really shitty take. I was diagnosed with anorexia in 2018, and have been using exercise as an alternative to starving myself. It's not because I'm 'fatphobic', I was conditioned to never accept myself the way I was from an early age. I'm sure many others are the same.	1245257496090095617

my anorexia is smarter than me. each time i start to see a bit of clarity, it clouds my vision back up. i’m blinded from everything. i think that the only way people can care about me is if they’re worried. anorexia has the upper hand. i’m gonna die from this. eventually.	1245973929082130432

I struggled with anorexia for 5 years. I was miserable. I hated my body. Now that I’m celebrating it, things are getting way out of hand. I’m taking my power back. You’re going to see why I promote body positivity. https://t.co/Ut8iXPBItc	1246159008001667072

It’s a pandemic, people are dying, people are happy to survive it or just grateful to be alive. What am I doing? I am starving myself which in reality is killing me slowly. Why? Anorexia feels like my only option to survive. No, I don’t know why exactly. But it breaks my heart.	1246170049464991746
I dont have dysphoria so when I see lesbians talking about wanting to look like males I just don't understand it. My friend described dysphoria to me like anorexia in the sense that it is kinda illogical.This really helped me a lot to have greater empathy for dysphoric lesbians	1246172605784059904

@kevin_jerrell Oh! I'm sure I had that. Growing up I suffered from anorexia nervosa and once I started gaining weight, I just really hated how my belly button looked. I really thought I was going crazy or was just extremely insecure. 😳	1246961257502117888

I would just like to clarify that I am proana for myself!!!! no one else,,,, I love all my moots and I want the best for y’all 🥺💞	1247342759163256832

getting over my anorexia was less about myself and more about unlearning harmful expectations of my body from society	1247351335957168131
Reminding myself of this daily in quarantine when it comes to trying to eat carb/sugar free, controlling anorexia relapses, and ideations getting any worse.  It's a struggle out here folx.	1247352587525001218
@mwatcher405 i’m sorry to say that most of my weight loss was due to adderall induced anorexia, i lost like 40 pounds in a month while i was on track in high school eating nothing, but right now im just doing a shitload of pushups, core sets, squats, and hiking, running helps a lot too !	1247355392662949890
@Ambrielle_Jade @Theyzzi Definitely. My binge eating used to reinforce those with anorexia and their comments and idolization of my body would reinforce my binge eating.  Eating disorders are a vicious cycle	1247357405802803200
anorexia i'm tired of you, please get out of me immediately.	1247359328971042821

my anorexia really can't give me a break? everyday for months i was trying my best to be healthy  but still those thoughts and feelings were always there to make me feel bad	1247373897189785602
I decided to work out, finish my report regarding anorexia and start my readings again. Mwehehe	1247376383338110977
@vkookchokeme You're not annoying at all !! I've had issues with anorexia before and my friends never really cared except for some and it makes me happy that someone is looking out for me although this time I'm not anorexic 💗💗	1247377173377212417
@michalsart I had to go on a “diet” where I literally ate more carbs than anything, lots veggies and fruits and water. It allowed me to beat my anorexia I also was only allowed to exercise twice a week (I would over do it normally to the point of making me sick) hope this helps keep touch💖	1247377804326551559
im so tired of girls wanting to actually have anorexia ???? i mean THE FUCK. we really are struggling and u are just forcing urself to have an eatind disorder ??????? bruh.	1247381008829370369

@VT_EdmCupid i couldn’t even wear makeup- he called it colored dirt i rub on my face, right after i said it was my passion.  i was scared of him.  took me a long time before i left. had to gather the courage.  i’m just glad i’m out of my anorexia  gained my weight back  all in the past now :)	1247393953206300672
Glad I've dodged anorexia and finally overcoming my body dysmorphia. Life's too great to isolate myself and it's better to live without trying to fit in the society's standard of beauty.	1247395693146173441
@ElijahJamez I know how you feel, I have been struggling with anorexia and bulimia and binge eating disorder, lastly with anorexia again my whole life. I'm happy that you have been able to resist, but you know that this is a self-esteem issue, right? I mean that you need to forgive yourself	1247396499006332930
i remember my best friend at the time being obsessed with getting a thigh gap and talking about having a thigh gap to the point where I wanted one too. i found out later that she was battling anorexia and i really should’ve known, but i was too young to know that was a sign	1247397277305454592

I’ve always been an active person but I need to go against that for the moment if I want to repair. Today I’m allowing myself very little movement, rest and for my Mum to feed me an abundance of food. Letting Anorexia go.	1247406376831406080
My Extreme Hunger felt like madness after being so scared of food for so long but a few weeks ago I was on deaths door. Anorexia tells me I’ve put all the weight back on in a week and I’m fighting this negativity all day. This is normal right?	1247407132527538178

Having a high metabolism isn’t fun at all. It’s one of my biggest insecurities so I bought a shirt that bit tight which gave my body a type of shape. So I wore it to school and I remember passing by some girls and they made fun of me calling me anorexia	1247466347178704896
I hate that high restriction makes me feel like I don't have THAT bad of an eating disorder. because people SEE me eat &amp; keep on eating. because I have no self control.  I don't act like I have anorexia at all.  I'm not starving myself for days anymore.  so why should they care?	1247475678611570689
@Usouph It was terrible bro, Amodiaquine nearly made me run mad with pruritus, dryness of the mucus membranes, nausea, anorexia, restlessness, hallucinations, my face felt like it was painted with a sticky substance, I couldn't shower for days.

@FAlRYWlNGS that's not my point. of course someone who thinks about getting an ed needs as much help as anyone else struggling with this. most of my irls just skipped ONE meal for a day and claimed to have anorexia. maybe i should have tweeted it in a different way but yall misunderstood it	1247493024814415872

@Ambrielle_Jade As a former anorexia, I got out of the dirt and put on some muscles and ate healthier foods and worked out 5-6x a week. If I can do it other people can do it. 💪🏼💪🏼👍🏼 took me 5 years to put on some muscle and good amount of strength. https://t.co/hOaItqOJnz	1247504992023568385
On the left is from my Tumblr days, as you can see I was much skinnier. That's from three years of starving myself from anorexia coming down from 250 ish to around 150. 135 being my lowest.

One of the biggest breakthroughs I had when recovering from anorexia was when I realised in order to recover, I had to lose the label.  I was anorexic. It was my identity. Without it, who was I?  I spent years trying to answer that question.   Who are you without the label?	1248033506367868928

Something I think a lot of people don’t understand about anorexia is that for a lot of us it’s not as simple as a fear of ‘fatness’, but more the fear of taking up more space in the world than you feel you deserve to.	1248935397016682496

@TRAGlC0MEDY @CINNAM0PUP I don’t, but they play a role in giving someone a good idea.  Even if they did have EDs, they mostly have the overeating type from what I’ve seen, and that’s equally as annoying to me when it comes to being misunderstood, as someone with anorexia. That’s not me insulting them.	1249176729324785667

@MagicalOverload I thought I was born an anorexic.  Turns out I had Celiac Disease, and that's why I always was sick &amp; throwing up, AND that family of origin was controlling and evil, so I gravitated to anorexia.  It was amazing to get diagnosed for CD in my 40's  and not be sick constantly.	1249435447648010242

Onision, you were one of my biggest triggers during my battle w/ anorexia. I’ll never forget you pretending to purge. A kick in the teeth.

@Georgie_Burg_45 I can’t even Georgie. I had a lot of people say some awful, insensitive things to me when I was finally diagnosed with anorexia, a year or so after I was raped.

@kali_thKitty Hell I was 181 at one point at 5'9. I didn't look healthy. I carry most of my fat in my stomach. I also didn't workout at the time.  I've also been anorexic as a teen but I don't see these idiots advocating for anorexia.  Bit of a double standard for both ends of eating disorders	1249466046827974660
Oh wow did some research and apparently this is normal in anorexia recovery! Now I don’t have anorexia but I am under 18 in bmi and have really bad eating habits so I guess the same biological factors fit me even tho the reason is different	1249470599304564738

@regan_mcdonagh Ok but why are you even searching because in order to find a proana account you have to be at least searching. People come to these accounts to vent.

@theshirarose Thank you for this 🙏🏻this is fatphobic society read to filth I.e. anti-fatness filtered through a feigned concern for ‘health’ and a reification of slimness as unquestionably the ‘healthy’ ideal. It’s been so toxic in my own precarious recovery from anorexia. Solidarity ❤️	1251181329305272326

@c_williams2335 A doctor told me at 15 I needed to smoke bc I literally never have an appetite, which caused anorexia. It is honestly the only way I can eat, calm down, or feel *less* pain from my herniated disc. Hell, my OB wants me to keep smoking during pregnancy bc lack of weight gain.	1251181854755106817

I had lunch with my youngest daughter today.   “So what?” you may say.   For several years, until last year, she was seriously ill with anorexia. So much so, we were in fear of losing her.   Today, she’s a beautiful young lady &amp; back to a healthy weight.   I’ve never been happier	1251516877819576323

bruh anorexia, bed, ednos (osfed), orthorexia, bulimia, arfid (sed), pica, and rumination are ALL real and VALID eating disorders. Not All of them have to do with weight loss. but they ALL have to do with food and eating. that's the bottom line. they all are MENTAL disorders	1251531425133801486

anorexia, and I’ve kept up with working out—and will continue to do so, but in a different capacity—as a means of combatting anxiety and insomnia. But the actual pushing-hard-to-gain size thing was always something I felt like I -should- be doing to fulfill a certain role.	1251601781563457542

To the first two questions yes. If you’re under Weight or just skinny, we can’t get certain jobs and people assume we have health problems. To answer your their question, we don’t get called obese but people do assume we have anorexia ...on the daily :)	1253361555925798912

@LoftyReece @juliannxo_ @MohWorldent @Shesofatty Anorexia does not have a size. And it’s completely ignorant of you to go up to a skinny person and tell them to eat. You don’t know what they do on a day-to-day basis or how their metabolism works. People have a hard time gaining weight sometimes.	1253403397920784386

bruh anorexia, bed, ednos (osfed), orthorexia, bulimia, arfid (sed), pica, and rumination are ALL real and VALID eating disorders. Not All of them have to do with weight loss. but they ALL have to do with food and eating. that's the bottom line. they all are MENTAL disorders	1253829554206117894

Every time I think about your intense “concern” over a fat person’s health, I laugh.  Because when I was dying of anorexia &amp; starving myself, I received nothing but praise.

If you can admit to yourself or another that ur not ok &amp; need help then you have so much strength and courage. It took me a decade to say the words I have “anorexia” and “bulimia” it was beyond hard &amp; so freeing. Be proud of the little, but powerful steps you take. #SickNotWeak	1254086947494146048

//TW: Ana mention  I swear if anorexia didn't decrease my vision idk I was able to see things in the far but now everything is so blurry ever since I recovered, I have to wear glasses to see things on TV clearly.   I've read lack of nutrition can do this so uugh I hate this.	1254222342667960320
@ShesOnlySarah @TruthSleuthYT I went from anorexia in my teens and 20s to binge eating in my thirties. I'm not at my highest anymore but it definitely doesn't make my ED issues illegitimate. Either way, in a way you're eating or not eating your feelings.	1254222472397946881

bruh anorexia, bed, ednos (osfed), orthorexia, bulimia, arfid (sed), pica, and rumination are ALL real and VALID eating disorders. Not All of them have to do with weight loss. but they ALL have to do with food and eating. that's the bottom line. they all are MENTAL disorders	1254295792560594944

@JuliaEccles1 Yes I find I'm doing well, then something small happens and it really knocks me.

@wyverning but that’s mental illness for you.

some proana told me i should't eat at least 3 hours before going to bed so i'm waiting til 4am to go to bed bc i binged at 1am :))	1254322038136803329
i act way less like someone with an eating disorder but in my disordered wired brain its like my anorexia is constantly SCREAMING at me for eating normally	1254322445043077121
I hate that this stupid illness makes me feel like I'm not suffering unless I'm starving. not sick until I'm frail. never bad enough for me to recover until the point it almost kills me.  nothing's good enough. anorexia just takes, and takes, and takes.	1254324557663531008

Lovely was then torn from her home of 12 years as a senior kitty, which was essentially a death sentence. Luckily an advocacy org saved her.  Depressed, she got anorexia and nearly died.

Today my husband and I celebrate 19 years of marriage. We have been through baby loss (x4), relocation to 3 different states, me developing Anorexia (in recovery for 6 years). We have cultivated a lot of joy, adventure, and laughter along the way. Happy Anniversary Sweetheart!	1255129543037186048

I dealt with anorexia and bulimia for all of my 20s and then they just seemed to go away in my 30’s. The past two weeks I’ve been starving myself because I don’t think I deserve anything AND letting food go to waste. I feel so utterly trapped and useless. Happy Tuesday.	1255133324709789703

@reece_dinsdale For people who suffer from anxiety these words could do a lot of damage.  I suffered from anorexia and an obsession to exercise in my teens because two people called me fat.

@suemgriffiths @reece_dinsdale My sister and mother always made comments about my weight and I was fortunate not to slide into anorexia, a boy in my class did though and it was shocking as anorexia was not really recognised, especially in lads.   But, I have still got issues with how I look, even at 56.	1255203925742977026

As someone with body dysmorphia and history of anorexia one of the best things I figured out was to never set weight goals. Like if I did I'd want to be 130ish pounds which is unreasonable.

I don't know if the aversion is tied to the anorexia I dealt with in my teens or pregnancy aversions (I couldn't touch meat with my 4th pregnancy and bread as a no-go with my 2nd - the smell was too strong).

jine, former member of oh my girl, left the group due to anorexia. she had a perfectly normal body, but she began to hate it. at the beginning of the promotions for ‘closer‘ she came back very skinny and two days after she was diagnosed with anorexia.	1255999145028063232

Was hospitalized from Sun. the 25th to Today(thurs) the 30th &amp; man i learned so much in Rehab. I had a better social life without a phone. I’m still recovering from wounds.

About a year ago I bought several new pairs of jeans. They're pretty big on me now (I can pull them about 8 inches from my waist) I still don't believe I lost weight. Every scale I've used for the last year+ has been broken in my mind. I kind of understand anorexia a bit better.	1256009470464847872

@the_bradpad I had a case of restricted eating when I was 14. I probably had anorexia, but was never formally diagnosed. I weighed 93 pounds at 5’7”.   It can give you control over your body when someone has taken that control away.	1256381341270249473

@marcmalkin @GenevieveAngel I had anorexia and then bulimia for a couple of years when I was 18-19.  Go one day at a time.  Eventually you will forget you have an eating disorder.

Toxic shame and guilt had me stand far off from Jesus for years. I couldn’t let him see me. At rock bottom of my anorexia and depression, He said, “Love, are you willing now to be seen?”  I answered “Yes, but I’m afraid.” And He said, “That’s okay, I see that too.”	1256415852477534208

A lot of my ED triggers are related to gender dysphoria, feeling ugly and loosing someone to anorexia last year. Most of my symptoms align with anorexia, but since weight isn’t my no.1 concern I’d say I’m more EDNOS. https://t.co/DPhxTSEVxU	1256471856774864896

@drone__syndrome For me either I don’t feel hungry when I’m supposed to be or I feel sick after eating.... yeah most of what I know about anorexia is image related but I don’t care about my image so probably other reasons	1256476330322915331

@kr_585 Non-image related anorexia is an entirely separate branch of diagnosis. For me, I just felt depressed whenever I ate, and was scared of throwing up if I ate something my stomach didn't like. I was about 40 pounds underweight, and honestly the meds they gave me saved me	1256477278902652928

At first it was because of racism, because I was a weird kid and my anxiety and my phobias, then because I started to get fat because of abuse, because of my depression, and when I lost weight (thanks anorexia (no)) it was because I wouldn't let (disgusting) guys hit on me	1256553812413857793

For a lot of my life I really struggled to be heard... and as a result had to find my own coping mechanism; for me this was in the form of anorexia  After a hosp admission I realised I had to express myself in a better way  One way I do this now is through therapy #Express4mind	1257204761134346240

i was 1lb away from being hospitalized w a feeding tube. i knew a change needed to happen, but i lost myself trying to heal myself. 4yrs later, i’m the happiest &amp; healthiest i have ever been. recovery isn’t easy, but it’s not impossible. anorexia, u lost this battle sweetie. https://t.co/YnIT8yMCSZ	1257571615359057922

Every time I think about your intense “concern” over a fat person’s health, I laugh.  Because when I was dying of anorexia &amp; starving myself, I received nothing but praise.   So tell me again, about this “health” you speak of?  Bec it sounds to me like an excuse to hate fat ppl	1257591210421760002
@ottelitag //Thank you 🥺 It just really gets me that those accounts are allowed, only to potential ruin all of the progress someone had made with healing from anorexia/bulimia	1257594913585315841

@thismorning the obesity discussion is triggering. I have dealt with anorexia for years,  it completely baffles me how that guy was suggesting it's peoples faults for not losing weight. Extreme weight loss and gain is mostly  incredibly complex and can't always get a quick fix 😒	1257601159231045632
also during this quarantine i realized my anorexia started probably middle school and that’s when i started hating myself and it’s so daunting realizing all the trauma i’ve withheld	1257603017223876608

also just have to put this out there: i developed 3 heart conditions, a lung condition, and liver/pancreas issues due to anorexia. i am NOT condoning this fucked up behaviour/mindset. i just made this acct for my own selfish reasons	1257607860063592448

@LauraPrepon took me back 8 years. I am not a mother, but since I was 15 I have had to take care of a baby who was barely 7 months old, just when my battle against anorexia.

Today anorexia is no longer part of my life, and although there is always a battle, I am still strong. He little one that entered my life, is already 8 years old and is the light of my eyes.

@Jaclynhill @LydiaEmillen your videos helped bring some peace during my last relapse with anorexia. The only time I would allow myself to sit down was to watch your videos. I love how you're always trying to be the best version of yourself, and inspire others to do the same 🥰	1257642156887617536

@Hannahclarke11 That tweet is about my battle in the past with anorexia which I’ve had to open up about after such cruel things were said.

I still get the most praise when I lose weight even from people who know my history with Anorexia.   Not when I graduated college. Not for having a 4.0 on grad school. Getting a new job etc...   Losing weight gets more supportive congrats than anything  And that’s the issue	1258184401487192065
Anorexia consumes so quickly.. literally 3 months ago I was metaphorically swimming in paradise, and now I’m drowning, constantly being pushed further under and hit harder with more and more waves	1258184694178418688
As someone who nearly lost my life to anorexia --  Do NOT praise someone with dramatic weight loss.	1258185495487623169

@harriepw Yep, anorexia was a combo of body image and self-harm with me and when I find myself needing to lose weight (which is/was often as I'm also an alcoholic) or the black dog shows up, it's very easy to fall into thinking 'fuck it, no food for a while'. It's fucking shit.	1258188211739865091

@SuperFastEddie1 @StPaulResident @p_s0909 And even IF she has an ED, recovery can look like gaining weight AND losing weight as binging is just as much of an ED as purging and anorexia. Attacking someone for being “too thin” can be extremely triggering for someone with an ED.	1258195602611081216

@SofieHagen @nicolettemason Thank you. I’ve considered myself an “overweight anorexic” for close to 20 years.  I technically beat anorexia and unintentionally traded it for obesity. I spent many unhappy years trying to lose weight and the anorexic inside of me was struggling. I now just live.	1258210918787362817
@dultsboi @GlamDamorous I am also non-binary. These two things are completely unrelated.  My BDD never had anything to do with my gender identity.

@JusticeTierney So let me get this right. This body positive and healthy at every size shit only applies to obese fuckers? Anorexia is an eating disorder and and unhealthy body image but stuffing your face &amp; being a whale is healthily? we should start using size zero models again if its HAES!	1258517316800704513

@OofableS @starrycaIs ed twt does NOT promote eating disorders. that’s only PROANA twt. ed twt is a safe place for us to vent abt our struggles with eds and all of us encourage recovery! please don’t take that away from us just bc proana twt is the first thing that comes up when you search ed twt	1258639502332977152
IM GONNA SAY IT. I’m so tired of people on here being so judgmental of what others say for sounding “proana”. LIKE MA’AM this is ed twt we are... mentally ill.

@BrennanSpiegel @cdc This is great!  If they would only add low to no appetite for weeks on end.  Took me seven weeks to get my appetite back, and that has NEVER happened before and I've lived many decades.  I'm assuming lack of full spectrum of GI symptoms means truly mild. Nausea and anorexia only.	1258819028619010048

@S0R3N_ Totally agree! I had the same thing happen to me twice from losing weight (via anorexia). All of a sudden people are nicer to me and hot people treat me differently/are friendlier.  Also I cannot believe Adele has been popular for 10 years already.... crazy.	1258827252227166208

my eating disorder started when i was 11 playing r*blox and some girl told me she was 5’8 and 80 lbs and only ate once every two weeks and i “convinced her to eat” but who knows how real it was. anyways i weighed myself after that and suddenly my search history was full of proana	1258835167684288513

@MissSimmySimmy @IamRouvafe The only time I managed to lose weight was when I literally could not afford food so would go days without eating, which then triggered the anorexia I had bested in my teens. But, yes, let's make weight the signifier of health.	1258842015023812608

I couldn’t understand why I was doing what I was doing until years and years later when I was able to reflect back it more clearly. I don’t starve myself with the mindset of LETS GET SHIT DONE. it makes me feel like it’s the only way to get by.  anorexia is a big fat ass liar	1259018973800259584

@kendramorous @Rockpicschick I struggled with my weight growing up and got bullied because of it.

@aliahdomino another hot take:   for me personally, binge eating disorder/bulimia was harder for ME to recover from than my period of anorexia. of course everyone’s different, but it’s interesting how society doesn’t see BED as an ED and even then they think it’s easy to overcome.	1259126855501660162

so... at this family dinner, my dad jokingly says “i ate too fast and now feel full. maybe i should throw up so i can finish my food” and then him and my mom start talking abt b/p and anorexia... uhhh the way that they’re so uneducated on that yet still talk abt it is ridiculous	1259635779975946240
Y misdiagnosis never bothered me till now, I've been diagnosed with bulimia, I know I have ednos tho, or leaning more to anorexia I restrict more than I b/p and even when I do, I still have an obsession with making my binge healthy. Anywayss, I didn't want to tell my therapist	1259635967293603840

Ok this isn't a joke at all. I think starting HRT might have gone a long way in curing my anorexia. I'm so hungry and craving protein and calories so bad y'all have no idea. I'm about 40 pounds under my target weight and have been stuck gaining and loosing the same 3 pounds 1/2	1260018516024913921
My parents ruined my mental and gave em anorexia by force feeding me to gain weight so where any eating made me want to throw up so i've been 120-123 for 3 years. But estrogen is really changing that. I'm craving food again and actual meals beyond snacks. I'm so happy ima' cry	1260018517325168641

tw!! pedo and proana  so like the dumb bitch I am I was on Omegle a while ago and was looking for someone to relate to and came across a 17 yo guy from Michigan. he was nice and pro ana which is awful but I'm sick so we traded snaps. I shared my face and he sent his.	1260037995505344513
tw!! pedo and proana  it started off nice and I just shared my stats and my body. never sent nudes or anything. he was understanding about my situation and how gross I looked. it was comforting?? I checked in with him daily, explaining my food. he would tell me it was too much.	1260038646578720769
tw!! pedo and proana  was serious but he sent me his dick.. and ofc I just kinda went along which was dumb but I can't handle these situations. I never sent anything back but he was super nice and said how cute I was. he mentioned wanting to f**k me but.. I didn't worry cause-	1260039635465646081
Very sad to know that in a few days, I again have to leave my family to receive anorexia treatment. I will be in treatment for who knows how long. I'm ready to finally kick this. 😟	1260039776117407748
@ThisBeSpitfire @ArtemisSolAnima When I was in high school, I had medically induced anorexia due to my medication, so I was underweight until it wasn't as easy to get because of how hard it was for me to get in with a doctor after I was twist away from pediatricians.  I gained a lot of weight with that.	1260039858430464001
Food thats suppose to taste like anorexia but taste good to me   baby carrots: just lovely to snack on I could eat like a cup of these for breakfast lunch and dinner actually I just might  Crushed ice with 0calstevia and 0cal caramel: idk man I just do	1260039996993568773
tw!! pedo and proana  I thought he was 17. he was always a bit angry that I might be a lesbian too? because he wanted me. he even offered to send me a scale since I don't have one. he asked for my tiktok but never gave his. I sent tik tok crushes.. we were friends.	1260040022964809728
tw!! pedo and proana  he was so nice and we talked about video calling. we said I love you because I appreciated someone for understanding. my ed was enjoying it. finally today I mentioned  vc.. and he was hesitant. finally he said he wished me the best and wanted me to recover.	1260040392315150337
tw!! pedo and proana  I want him to get help, that's all. I don't know what to do anymore. I screen recorded his face and all the messages. if I show anyone like my parents or the police I'll be sent back into treatment and never trusted again.	1260041952747290627
i wish that like, i wasn't doing this alone irl. it's just sad, shopping alone, making food alone, eating alone, exercising alone, starving alone, watching mukbangs alone LMFAO. realistically it's kinda proana to have essentially an irl anabuddy but this disorder is so lonely.	1260043198317031424

@tarafarrell93 @HarrietParsons It’s awful Tara,  💔   I currently pay my dietitian €100 a week, I can’t afford it, as I’m not working due to anorexia, but  I don’t have an alternative, there are no dietitans in my primary or secondary service. Which is why I get furious when a different picture is painted	1260207262838259712

I had lunch with my youngest daughter today.   “So what?” you may say.   For several years, until last year, she was seriously ill with anorexia. So much so, we were in fear of losing her.   Today, she’s a beautiful young lady &amp; back to a healthy weight.   I’ve never been happier	1260237638952464389

I need to display a sense of normalcy so that nobody suspects I have an ed so I have to actually eat at least once a day. I do bake and cook a lot for friends but never eat them myself.   Probably this is what’s keeping me from having full blown downward spiral anorexia	1260833976433942529
@cheetah_paws Yep started working out again and added some splits to my routine to work on flexibility as well, from the limit of anorexia (lockdown doesn't help to stay healthy :/). You're really good at motivating me both in exercise and drawing!	1260835296230420480

@NotStraightKate Bless you, im not someone to look up to 😂 bounced between services for years, the eating disorder service knew to resolve anorexia I need to have srs. But the gender identity service wouldnt let me have srs while I was anorexic because i wasnt considered to have informed consent	1260851602778456064

Why do people with anorexia not want to recover from something that is killing them? Here are some of my thoughts.  https://t.co/2MH3JhvEXc	1260871048209235968
This just convinced me to go down and make my sandwich after seeing something proana and deciding I won’t eat 🥺 thank you for posting this &lt;33	1260873104131317760

Okay so after nearly 8 years of anorexia and swinging between recovery attempts and realspe my metabolism is well and truly fucked. I want to get it back so I’ve decided to try high restriction but idrk how to go about it. If anyone here has any tips pls dm me 🥺💞💞	1260875742021398536

I was dying when I posted this. literally. was in the hospital a couple days before this picture getting a ekg cause my heart was tweaking out from anorexia and I was admitted to an inpatient program a month later yet I was being congratulated for my weight loss in my comments https://t.co/vjllyQg7Y2	1260893838723256321
3 years ago I was deep in anorexia, at my lowest weight, frequent suicide attempts, failing school &amp; in a highly toxic relationship.

@florian_krammer Gastro version of Covid-19 gifts several weeks of anorexia.  Do stay safe!  I had the anorexia but forced myself to eat once a day, because I didn't think losing weight while sick was sustainable weight loss.  But it is happening to others, some lose 20 pounds in a few weeks.	1260934225953357826

Joking about anorexia when your not diagnosed is just like joking about having another mental disability. The difference is I've seen more people die from this than anything in my life. The qualifications for anorexia are you have to weigh under a certain weight for adult years.	1261678009221709825

Not eating once a day to be skinny is not anorexia. There was a time where all I ate for five days was lemon water. I fainted in class. Had to go to the hospital after a seizure came in pursuit. Don't demean me.	1261680074857648128

I don’t get sad about my new body anymore, in fact I’m even starting to really like it!! I see it as a body that will one day make me babies and that thought only ever puts a smile on my face. Anorexia recovery and overcoming body dysmorphia is possible 😌 #anorexiarecovery	1262338325739974659
3 years ago today I was finally discharged from the Eating Disorder Youth Service, after struggling with Anorexia for 5 years. 3 years on and I’ve never had a healthier body &amp; I no longer let food or exercise control my life.

Where do you go to get anorexia?	1262343422205063169
@cloudyollie 5 days. Im still mad thst i didn't get the change to go a full week cuz ik i couldve done it. This was back in my glory days of anorexia when i was obese. I was like blacking out in therapy and then they told me that if i didnt eat they were gonna put me on a hold so i ate :(	1262346516607324160
I’m 24 now, had anorexia from 11 until 22 and I’m still struggling with the thoughts and have had OCD for as long as I can remember. I don’t talk about it a lot but  #itsOkayToNotBeOkay and I’m always here if anyone ever needs to talk. #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek	1262353039563898881

Some yall gross	1262362644637462528
@MelissaFloBix There are many but the biggest one within the last year has been diet culture. I have a friend dying from anorexia who’s taught me a lot &amp; I will now never congratulate a person on weight loss ever again.	1262370670710841347
I’ve battled anorexia my entire life. It usually stems from a bout of anxiety, mixed with insecurity about what I see in the mirror. This picture was taken in 2014 when I hit my lowest. You are not alone. It’s okay not to be okay. #itsOkayToNotBeOkay #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek https://t.co/xxR5ZAecV6	1262396315700531200
i guess i just don’t have healthy daily eating habits, so instead of maintaining... i just binge eat then fast to feel like i have anorexia again, and then binge eat again to feel like i’m recovering again.. there’s no fucking middle ground for me.	1262397204775546883

do i really have anorexia or am i just a bitch with body image issues who cries about her food daily and eats too much :( i’m so invalid	1262434187350618114
i’ve suffered with anorexia for about 10 years. it comes and goes. sometimes i think i’m doing okay, then it all disappears and i won’t eat for weeks.   anyway, the heaviest i’ve ever been was 64kg, at 13 years old.	1262436819452518402
@mikers86 My favorite was “you should be so ingrained in your work that sometimes you  forget to eat or don’t even want to when working on your translations”......it didn’t hit me until like a couple months later that she was essentially promoting anorexia in order to get more work done.	1262439757688102912
@bethindrinktea Uhmmm.... idk... can u have anorexia if u don’t count cals?	1262440258404319232

Whenever I see calories don’t count today ,, I’m like ? Can I just? Wait, anorexia, bitch tf — can I have that option? Can I, wait! I don’t cry, or fast afterwards, or scream at my family or lie about what I ate or refuse to eat anything else. I didn’t know it did that in my head	1262453688322404352
Emotion coaching for parents is a new tool that could help teenagers recover from anorexia. UGA psychologists and collaborators at @CincyChildrens have developed supplemental interventions to use in addition to family-based therapy to treat anorexia. https://t.co/4SEs1TdxLW	1262454154078728193
i started showing signs of anorexia and depression when i was 10 years old.  other than cups of water and a few pieces plain biscuits, i rarely ate. all because my aunt told me that i looked fat in a dress that i loved.  my ribs were poking out. i was stick thin. i was all bones.	1262455114154926085

TW: eating disorder/anorexia!!!! Not trying to start a discourse here but look at me roast this dipshit on a post claiming that the way Adele lost weight was by consuming less than 1000 calories a day and eating only fruit, green juice, and red wine (????) lmao https://t.co/FoAQntYSnk	1262503109135343619
"""Similarly to how my anorexia didn't garner concern since I was slim but not """"unhealthily"""" so, orthorexia is seen as applause-worthy. Phrases like """"clean eating"""" showcase our moralizing of personal health/food intake but orthorexia is detrimental just like other disordered eating."""	1262508925804515328
@MyUsernamesThis Yeah, I was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa, Anxiety, Depression, and Body Dysmorphia. I never got help until it was visible, and that’s when my Mother got me to get help. I remember hating her a lot, but now, i’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be alive without her.	1262512108211777538

bruh anorexia, bed, ednos (osfed), orthorexia, bulimia, arfid (sed), pica, and rumination are ALL real and VALID eating disorders. Not All of them have to do with weight loss. but they ALL have to do with food and eating. that's the bottom line. they all are MENTAL disorders	1262522409741094914

I’ve had 2 medical professionals tell me I don’t look like I have anorexia, I don’t look like I starve myself &amp; I look “too healthy for that” in the last week and it’s really getting to me. I am underweight &amp; still quite a while off my target weight but my head is now such a mess	1262860679058460672

@Celine_AD I have had this before with a GP when I was recovering so obviously gained a fair bit of weight but doesn’t mean I didn’t have anorexia just as bad in my head. I remember crying for hours until I realised the problem is their ignorance not me. Hope you are okay 💕	1262862740215009280

Anorexia. I was first diagnosed and hospitalized at 17. I was in recovery for a short period of time, then relapsed in my 20s. Then was better for a bit. Then relapsed again. In the past year I've been diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorder, and advised to check into residential.	1264867755515236352
@jaireville 6 and 7 for me. 4 sounds like a double-edged sword; if I can't gain weight &amp; can only lose it, hello anorexia. 1 would scare everyone. 2 is too temp. 3 is forgetting the good lessons too. 9 is useless, 5 is inconvenient, &amp; 8 removes most of my humanity.	1264869897781145606

ED TW !!  I’ve had issues with anorexia for a long time now, but as soon as I started recovering, I got hit with a health issue that prevents me from being able to eat normal amounts without vomiting. I legit dropped more than 10% of my body weight in the past few months.	1266256471181758465
I developed an eating disorder, which I also meticulously hid. These days, some of my best friends in high school tell me they never knew I had anorexia because I never allowed myself to get to where I looked like I had it, and I was methodical in my habits to hide it.	1266257521435504641
This day ten years ago, I was admitted to an inpatient unit for anorexia for the first time. Back then I really thought this was the beginning of the end. Little did I know, it was the start of self-discovery; I am strong, courageous, and I deserve to love myself who I am. 🦋	1266274895614246918

No offence to Matt in the slightest, but when I did this I was put on a four year waiting list and told to set an alarm on my phone to remind me to eat.

Scientology then because they lied to the opposite. I was so healthy. My skin soft. From my lifestyle &amp; diet. In my 30's, which is typical when working that much.

@playboiellie maybe it’s a controversial opinion but i think you can’t recover and want to lose weight at the same time. at least if you’re trying to recover from anorexia, because the main symptom is wanting to lose weight/fear of gaining. you can’t recover if you’re not ready to let that go	1266447692529623041

@mskirstencollin 1/2 I have recovered from anorexia and bulimia that could have killed me. It started around age 15 seriously and became less serious age 20. But I still made myself sick periodically till I was 25. I’m fully recovered now &amp; have been for a while.	1266819915979374592
@mskirstencollin I consider myself to still be in recovery, but I've been free from ED's for almost 9 years now.  I suffered first as a teen with anorexia, then was bulimic on and off for 20+ years. I was lucky enough to have psychotherapy for depression and severe anxiety. It really helped.	1266828035535392768

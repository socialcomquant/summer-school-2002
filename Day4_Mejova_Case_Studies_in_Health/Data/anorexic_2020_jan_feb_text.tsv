@thwobbing @incommons1 @dezrainh wanting to have anorexia is having anorexia ken. when i was hospitalized it was after a year of training myself to starve because i wanted to be anorexic. i wanted to be sickly thin. the illness itself derives from wanting the illness. theres no such thing as wannarexia.	1212499693374181376

@moncherixxo I think it‚Äôs glorified anorexia &amp; will result in binge eating disorder for a LOT of people.

5 things people DO know but are important to my identity:  1. i'm about to finish my ph.d. in psychology+neuro  2. i almost died from anorexia when i was 19 and was hospitalized for months but now i've been recovered for years  3. i like red lipstick	1213620728148443137
A few months later, I started restricting severely and the purging started again. I now had anorexia.  I started getting praised just like my mom.  I was being praised for literally taking actions that were killing me.	1213623727432327168

The dysphoria preceded the anorexia, was the major catalyst.

The anorexia, depression, self-harm, suicidality, wasted time from postponing transitioning, etc. are what harmed me. Transitioning hasn't done so. It's allowed me to live a life in a body that feels like my own, that I'm for the first time seeking to improve. Good outcome, IMO.	1214571231703224320

today in my philisophy class we were talking about beauty &amp; society and eating disorders/anorexia came up but then she told us her aunt was admitted to a hospital for bulimia despite being at a normal weight and for some reason i just felt weird the rest of the day.	1215051146328326144
After struggling with anorexia for so long and a whole year of meeting with my eating disorder team, I can finally say say that I am in remission. It was such a bittersweet moment to meet with them for the last time, but I am soooo incredibly grateful to be where I am now. :)	1215052555492806656
@kittendrawers @Account81113995 @momofmab @rgay @AM2DM @JillianMichaels 'Obese' is a slur, don't throw that sh*t on my timeline.  It's absolutely okay to be fat. Fat people have existed since time immemorial. And if we eradicated fatphobia we would eradicate anorexia. It's also okay to not have perfect health. Health is not a moral issue.	1215052804252782592

i was *this* close to committing suicide in grade 8 at 13. i was severely depressed. and i didn‚Äôt know why.  grade 9 &amp; 10, i seemed to be living happily without mental illness. i loves my life &amp; was happy with myself.  then 2 weeks after grade 11 started, i was 15 &amp; got anorexia.	1215121651743870976
developed anorexia. i wonder if i‚Äôd be healthy, happy, &amp; leading the life of an ordinary 17 year old. i wonder if all of what i went through from ages 7-13 impacted the development of my ed at 15. i went from happy &amp; living my best life to anorexic in a minute.	1215121653497090048
she never got me therapy when i was cutting at 9. i remember on my 11th birthday, she noticed cuts on my arm &amp; yelled at me. she never took notice of my depression at 13. i‚Äôve had anorexia for almost 2 years &amp; she discourages me eating more than 500 calories (unknowingly, sorta).	1215121655162261504

Now for Anorexia:  So when you have anorexia is when you have a very low weight  less than 85 percent of normal body weight.  Fear of gaining weight at all and having a distorted view of your body. = believing they're overweight.   Symptoms: restricting food; bingeing then purge https://t.co/1kl92seVCF	1216695065898340352

@MsBlaireWhite Preach it. Anorexia gave me osteopenia and put me in dentures all before the age of 22. Had my first heart attack at 15. Totally glamorous right üôÑ Can we just appreciate healthy bodies and not glamorize/fetishes unhealthy behaviors ü§¶	1216920251566346240

In 4 decades of #mentalhealth issues, what's been my toughest struggle... anorexia? no self-harm? no addiction? no recovery from a psychiatrist stopping 5 meds at once, no taper?

Also fun fact. I haven‚Äôt owned a scale for more than 2 years now. When I had one for the two years before that I refused to get on it because my anorexia was so bad.

@ElRoiShalom @capngonzo Brilliant.  I've battled my love/hate relationship with food all my life.  I'm at the hate stage.  I eat to live, that's it, but I'm far from anorexic. GOD did me a favor when I had to have #RatiationHELL, now, I can barely taste food.  I gave my character Anorexia #LovesMuses	1216944295615377410
@ElRoiShalom @capngonzo I'm 57, and I think I'll have a food problem for the REST of my days. I was 95lbs here.

@Protocollier @lilith_cenobite @savagejen I think OP's point is that statistics are skewed. Doctors are biased.

Absolutely no one looks at me and thinks - yeah they might have an ED and I'm pretty sure my friends who do know regularly forget.  I'm still battling the anorexia that made me fat in the first place and I wish I saw more representation of people like me in the discourse	1218239332760223744

told my friend about my ed cause her sister had anorexia when she was 16 and now shes cool so i wanted to know about it.... the thing is now she is worried and she wants to go have toASTS for breakfast oh lord im so scared of bread	1218244159892545536
Also to anyone concerned if my anorexia is a diagnosis -  no. I've been lying to my psychiatrist so she can't give me that diagnosis but we both know she knows as is shown by the fact that I'm not allowed to have my Adderall if I don't continue to eat at least lunch each day :)	1218245412286431234

its just. its at the point where i don't leave my house at all because i'm so repulsed by my body. at least when i was sick, i may not have had the energy to do anything, but i still DID everything. i feel like i have less of a life right now than i did w anorexia . doesnt add up	1218252964613124097

TW Restriction. This has got to be one of the most irresponsible things I have seen, restricting to such a low intake may have short term benefits, (ask anyone with anorexia, it triggers a euphoric feeling) long term it is completely dangerous. https://t.co/lpeXRqS7zZ	1218347735587397632

@conelradcosmos @ireenee_b hi i‚Äôm nowhere near this thick and beautiful but i had a lot of trouble with anorexia and it helped me to eat very very little at once but multiple times a day (like small snacks). a lot of people dive in and try to eat full meals and relapse and i don‚Äôt want that to be you!!üíò	1218364075043885056

Not healthy at all.. leads to anorexia/ bulimia.  Eat whatever you want and live your life. I spent so many years of my life counting calories and barely eating 400 calories a day. I‚Äôve been in ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù for 3 years and I still struggle and will probably always be a struggle.	1218385656428187649

@lizziedlizard @badgirlkiki_ Hello! I went to an outpatient center for chronic anorexia, and it absolutely saved my life.

@HopeVirgo Fantastic to see change happen! When I was trying to access help for my eating disorder, the psychiatrist I saw told me exactly how much weight I still have to lose to be ill enough to qualify for specialized eating disorder/anorexia treatment.

ED ment   Probably lots of yall don't know but I had anorexia for 5 years from age 11-16. No one cared because I was fat. I ate dinner at home and no lunch at school. It stemmed from being afraid of people seeing me eat and making fun of me because I was fat.	1218597525411725312
It's been 9 years since I beat anorexia and I've been slipping on eating because of my depression but it's a different feeling that it used to be. Little things like the meal I made that's fun and feels like a treat is a good thing when you're depressed (ya know, self care)	1218599739182276609

Dear @BBCNews, @beatED and @tomquinn1,  Going vegan IMPROVED my relationship with food. Going vegan made me feel SO much less guilty about eating when I was suffering most with anorexia - the ethical problems weren't tainting food anymore. Please don't present only one side. https://t.co/ENpy5evJiJ	1221457039920173057
During my anorexia treatment, I had to fight for my therapist to understand that my veganism was for ethical reasons and not restrictive. He tried over and over to make me drop my vegan diet, which caused me great distress and nearly made me drop out of the treatment entirely.	1221457041862070272

hmmm, I was hospitalized for anorexia, spent several of my teenage &amp; adult years dealing with the idea that I‚Äôd always be ‚Äúthe super skinny girl‚Äù, so I needed to maintain that figure.. just to have someone say ‚Äúit‚Äôs not as bad‚Äù. it is just as hurtful.	1222824095282159617
@softnsquishybby @madirayk My cousin tried to commit suicide three times before 9th grade because of the violent bullying she received for being underweight.

The 1st time I had #ECT, was coerced. Had anorexia, wouldn't eat. #Psychiatrist said, ECT or tube feeding. Nurses said, better eat, do ECT, or tube feeding tomorrow. Didn't want to eat, so did ECT. They chose to electroshock my brain into seizures when I hadn't eaten for a weeküò∂	1223227206144602114

Been one of toughest weeks I can recall this. Utterly heartbreaking to see my wonderful, kind, caring, thoughtful 9 yr old in the grips of anorexia. Yes, 9.   5 days on a drip, totally unable to accept there‚Äôs an issue, feeling helpless is the worst feeling a parent can have.	1223734495620272128

I was 15 5'9 and 110 pounds on the left. I dealt with anorexia for 2 years when I was in high school and it never crossed my mind that I was actually unhealthy.

i nearly burst into tears and had a panic attack because they didn‚Äôt have my usual drink.

@WallySierk In theory, you‚Äôre supposed to get roughly the same amount, just in less time. In practice, most people eat somewhat less just because you can only have so much at one sitting.

Sometimes, I‚Äôm tempted to compare my experience with anorexia to the experiences of others. I‚Äôm tempted to tell myself that my experience wasn‚Äôt as bad as it could have been.   Don‚Äôt do this to yourself. Don‚Äôt downplay what you‚Äôve been through. No good comes from it.	1233186353594191882

@James_s_welsh @TruthSleuthYT Yikes... During my recovery from anorexia my skin was awful because of the hormonal imbalances. I'd get comments like that said to my face all the time, no one bothered to ask what I was going through.

My anorexia developed after years of pressure and comments surrounding eating and body image. All of the women around me focused a lot on their weight and dieting. I never really saw the women around me being happy with their body.	1233462119917608960
@Robfm @SimonKelly14 @AthenaNike4 @womenslibrary @ScotlandSisters @san_alland No, I meant validate. When I suffered from anorexia I believed I was fat, I looked in the mirror and saw fat. I wasn't fat. I had a mindset which told me something that wasn't true. My anorexia stemmed from other issues which needed confronting, not validating.	1233463035173445634

I‚Äôll never be absolved from anorexia &amp; even after being told I was recovered two years ago I knew that it didn‚Äôt mean I was cured/would never fall back into it. That doesn‚Äôt mean my life is controlled by my ED, it means if I let it, my eating disorder will control my life	1233492332915417095
I‚Äôve met so many people who experience disordered eating of some sort &amp; didn‚Äôt know how common it was until I spoke up ab my own disease.
